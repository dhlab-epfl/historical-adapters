        "Question: Which of the following could Gordon's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer: The answer is",

The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.\nA certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.\nThis different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.\nFigure: muscles in the human body.\nOptions: (A) chloride channel protein . . . CLCN1 gene (B) CLCN1 gene . . . chloride channel protein\nAnswer: The answer is",

        "Question: Which term matches the picture?\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning\nAnswer: The answer is",

        "Question: Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nContext: Read the text about cats.\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.

        "Question: Based on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nContext: Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech.\nAnswer: The answer is",

        "Question: Which of the following could Gordon's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer: The answer is A. A parachute with a 1 m vent will be steadier at 200 km per hour than a parachute with a 2 m vent, since the smaller parachute's weight is less than half of the larger parachute's weight.\nA parachute can be used to slow down a heavier object.

        "Question: Which of the following could Robert's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer: The answer is B. The parachute would not be damaged, because the net force on the parachute would be downward.

Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey.\nOptions: (A) echinoderm (B) cnidarian\nAnswer: The answer is A. A cnidarian is a member of the phylum Cnidaria. A cnidarian has a radially symmetrical body with a soft body surface and an outer layer of tentacles called tentacles. These tentacles contain stinging cells called nematocords. Cnidarians are also called soft-bodied animals because their bodies are soft and lack a skeleton.\nFigure 2 shows a cnidarian tube",

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nCarter put one two-inch steel nail into each of six test tubes. He added water to three of the test tubes and vinegar to the other three. In each test tube, he completely covered the nail with the same volume of liquid. Carter checked the nails for rust at the same time every day. He recorded how many days it took each nail to become completely covered in rust. Then, he compared the number of days it took nails to rust in water to the number of days it took nails to rust in vinegar.\nFigure: a new steel nail on a pile of rusty nails.\nOptions: (A) Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar? (B) Do steel nails rust in fewer days when submerged in a large volume of liquid compared to a small volume?\nAnswer: The answer is A. This is because the metal in steel nails is less reactive than the metal in vinegar. Metals such as steel do not rust in water, while acids such as vinegar do. The reaction between the metal in the nail and the metal in the vinegar speeds up the rate of corrosion. So, more corrosion occurs, which is why a nail in vinegar corrodes faster than a nail in water.",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nJennifer and Scarlett were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nOptions: (A) if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use (B) if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry\nAnswer: The answer is B. Because the concrete from three different batches took the same amount of time to dry, each batch of concrete was firm enough to use.\nA slump test can be used to find the slump of concrete by observing how well each batch of fresh concrete flows.

Then, he rinsed and dried the penny, and repeated the test using water mixed with hand soap. He repeated these trials on nine additional pennies. Ivan compared the average number of pure water drops to the average number of water drops mixed with hand soap that he could add to a penny before the water spilled over.\nFigure: a dome of water on the surface of a penny.\nOptions: (A) Can pennies hold more drops of water mixed with dish soap or water mixed with hand soap?

Bridget was a bioengineer who wanted to increase the amount of insulin that the bacteria produced by 20%. She read that giving the bacteria more nutrients could affect the amount of insulin they produced. So, Bridget gave extra nutrients to some of the bacteria. Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients.\nFigure: studying bacteria in a laboratory.\nOptions: (A) whether producing more insulin would help the bacteria grow faster (B) whether she added enough nutrients to help the bacteria produce 20% more insulin (C) whether different types of bacteria would need different nutrients to produce insulin\nAnswer: The answer is B.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nAnswer: The answer is C. A parachute with a 1 m vent would not be evenly distributed, so the spacecraft would not be steady at 200 km per hour.\nA parachute is a device that slows a spacecraft's speed as it enters the atmosphere of a planet.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMitchell, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Mitchell thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\nOptions: (A) if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second (B) how much athletes would sweat in the fabric (C) how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\nAnswer: The answer is C.\nContext: When athletes exercise, their bodies produce a thin layer of sweat, which is made of water and salt.

The drops stayed together and formed a dome on the penny's surface. Pablo recorded the number of drops he could add before the water spilled over the edge of the penny. Then, he rinsed and dried the penny, and repeated the test using water mixed with hand soap. He repeated these trials on nine additional pennies. Pablo compared the average number of pure water drops to the average number of water drops mixed with hand soap that he could add to a penny before the water spilled over.\nFigure: a dome of water on the surface of a penny.\nOptions: (A) Can pennies hold more drops of pure water or water mixed with hand soap? (B) Can pennies hold more drops of water mixed with dish soap or water mixed with hand soap?\nAnswer: The answer is A. Pennies can hold more drops of pure water than water mixed with hand soap. This is because pure water is less dense than water mixed with hand soap. Less dense means a smaller amount of water takes up the same amount of space. If a penny holds 20 drops of pure water, it can hold more than 20 drops of water mixed with hand soap. If a penny holds 20 drops of pure water, 20 m",

        "Question: Which term matches the picture?\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\nOptions: (A) operant conditioning (B) classical conditioning\nAnswer: The answer is A. Classical conditioning focuses on reinforcing behaviors that are caused by environmental factors. Operant conditioning focuses on reinforcing behaviors that are caused by environmental factors.\nOptions: (A) classical conditioning (B) operant conditioning\nAnswer: The answer is A. Classical conditioning focuses on reinforcing behaviors that are caused by environmental factors. Operant conditioning focuses on reinforcing behaviors that are caused by environmental",

        "Question: Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?\nContext: Read the text about cats.\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses. (B) The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers. (C) The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice. (D) The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.\nAnswer: The answer is A.\nContext: In ancient Egypt, farmers kept their grain in pits. But mice and other animals sometimes broke into these pits and ate the grain. The cats protected the grain from the mice. The cats also helped farmers find better places to store their grain.\nQuadriplets are twins and their two older siblings. Their parents have five eggs, but only two of the quadruplets are girls.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nAnswer: The answer is C.

        "Question: Which of the following could Mason's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMason was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer: The answer is A. A parachute with a 1 m vent will be slower than a parachute with a 2 m vent. A parachute with a 1 m vent moves with air and air pressure strikes the parachute on all sides. A parachute with a 2 m vent will not move as much because the air pressure strikes the parachute on only one side.\nWhy does a parachute move?\nA parachute moves because it",

The drops stayed together and formed a dome on the penny's surface. Percy recorded the number of drops he could add before the water spilled over the edge of the penny. Then, he rinsed and dried the penny, and repeated the test using water mixed with hand soap. He repeated these trials on nine additional pennies. Percy compared the average number of pure water drops to the average number of water drops mixed with hand soap that he could add to a penny before the water spilled over.\nFigure: a dome of water on the surface of a penny.\nOptions: (A) Can pennies hold more drops of water mixed with dish soap or water mixed with hand soap? (B) Can pennies hold more drops of pure water or water mixed with hand soap?\nAnswer: The answer is A. Pennies can hold more drops of water mixed with dish soap than drops of pure water. The reason is that dish soap is more dense than water. Dish soap is a solid that is heavier than water. So, when a drop of dish soap hits a penny, it sits on top of the penny rather than spreading out. Compared to a drop of pure water, a drop of dish soap is more likely to spread out",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer: The answer is B. A parachute with a 1 m vent can be steady for 1 km because the air drag is balanced by the amount of lift provided by the parachute. A parachute with a 1 m vent would not be steady for 1 m because the air drag is not balanced by the lift.\n26: An airplane is moving at a speed of 400 km per hour and has a mass of 100 kilograms",

(B) When wrapped in a cotton shirt and placed in the sun, does a large jar or a small jar heat up more? (C) When placed in the sun, does a glass jar wrapped in cotton heat up more than a glass jar wrapped in wool?\nAnswer: The answer is A. The glass jar wrapped in a black cotton shirt will heat up more than a glass jar wrapped in a white cotton shirt. This is because the dark object absorbs more heat than a light object.

        "Question: Based on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nContext: Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals. (B) They can communicate about specific problems. (C) They can understand some human speech.\nAnswer: The answer is A.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with other animals. (B) They can communicate with other animals. (C) They can communicate with other humans.\nAnswer: The word \u2018communicate\u2019 can be used to describe how animals can send messages to each other.\nOptions: (A) transport (B) transportation (C) communicate\nAnswer: The answer is C.\nOptions: (A) They can carry things from place to place.

        "Question: Which of the following could Manny's test show?\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nManny was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Manny put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer: The answer is C. A parachute with a small vent has less drag than one with a large vent. The smaller the vent, the less drag there is.\nLook at the following table.\nVent size Drag Force\nsmall 0.5 N small 0.5 N large 1.0 N\nDrag means the force that opposes motion.

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nAshley built an electric circuit: she used wires to connect a battery to a light bulb, the light bulb to a small piece of copper, and the copper back to the battery. When the circuit was complete, the light turned on. Ashley observed the brightness of the light for five seconds. She then replaced the copper with a piece of iron of equal size and noted whether the light became brighter or dimmer. Ashley built three more of the same type of circuit. She repeated the tests with each circuit. Ashley recorded whether the circuits produced brighter light when the circuit included copper or when the circuit included iron.\nFigure: a circuit with a battery, a light bulb, and a piece of copper.\nOptions: (A) Do circuits that include iron produce dimmer light than circuits that include copper? (B) Can light bulbs stay lit longer when circuits include copper or when circuits include iron?\nAnswer: The answer is A. In a circuit with iron, more electrons are able to move than in a circuit with copper. Thus, the circuit produces more light. When a circuit includes iron, less electrical energy is converted into light and more light is produced. This means the light bulb will stay lit shorter.\nOne way to help you explore this question is to draw two circuits. In one circuit, copper is the conductor.
